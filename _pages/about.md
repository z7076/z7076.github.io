I am currently a DPhil student at Control Group from University of Oxford, advised by Prof. Antonis Papachristodoulou and Prof. Jack Umenberger.  
<!-- My research interests lie in system control and optimization. I am currently working on safe data-driven control on voltage and frequency regulation in power systems.   -->

In 2024, I graduated from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) with a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. I was a student at the Smart Grid and Renewable Energy Lab from [Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yinliang Xu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/xyl/main.htm).

In 2021, I graduated from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation.
